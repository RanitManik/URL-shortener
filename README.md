# Simple URL Shortener

This is a simple URL Shortener application built using Node.js, MongoDB, mongoose and the EJS Template Engine. It allows users to shorten long URLs into concise, shareable links, tracks how many times each link has been accessed, and redirects users to the original URL when a shortened link is visited.
